-   Introduction

-   `Innovation`

    -   Relevance for Neuropsychology :fire:

-   `Shiny` Apps:

    -   **Case Study 1:** Score Converter :chart_with_upwards_trend:

    -   ~~**Case Study 2:** Reliable Change :stopwatch:~~

::: notes
-   Going to talk a little about

    -   Innovation.

    -   Why it is relevant for neuropsychological practice.

    -   And then I am going to demonstrate an app that I have been working on.

-   Unlikely to have time to go through both apps today.

-   I will signpost and briefly mention the reliable change app. But is anyone is interested is statistical approaches to change over time then feel free to message me!

## Innovation

[**Introductory Exercise:**]{.underline} <countdown time="120"/>

1.  Are we **`Consumers`** or **`Producers`** of technology/innovation?

2.  What innovations have **`You`** been involved with?

3.  Which **`Colleagues`** do you think of when it comes to innovation?

. . .

-   **Tips:**
    -   Scorers and Software.

    -   Tele-Conferencing and Technology.

    -   Service Developments.

    -   Interventions.

    -   Research.

::: notes
-   As a psychologist/neuropsychologist, do you see yourself as a **`consumer`** of technology, or a **`producer`** of technology?
-   What innovations, developments, or idea have you been involved with or acted upon?
-   What about your colleagues? Who do you look to when you think of a colleague who strives for innovation? Who has helped to turn the needle?
-   Purpose of this task is to get you thinking explicitly about you as an individual, a service, a department, organisation, and how you have contributed to local innovation.

This is really informal, but it would be nice if some of you could jot down some ideas. I am going to come back to this in a few slides and invite people to feedback with what came to mind for people.

::: notes
-   Analytical:

-   Scientific method:

-   Progress:

-   Public sector:

    -   We appreciate the economical argument.

-   Our history:

    -   We literally founded the empirical investigation between brain and behaviour.

-   Assessment:

    -   Think of all the empirically supported assessment tools.

We should feel good about ourselves!

I would argue that we should position ourselves as developers even more! As a field we are heavily involved in neuroscience, measurement, and advancing treatments.

We should remind ourselves about how we participate in and lead this edge of innovation!
:::

## Innovators!

Neuropsychologists are model innovators wtihin healthcare!

But where is leading the endeavour for `Neuropsychology`?

![](img/srft.jpg){.fragment fig-align="center" width="600" height="500"}

::: notes
-   Hopefully, I'm starting to convince you all about about how innovation is intrinsic to the way in which we work in neuropsychology.

-   The neuropsychology collective are model field for innovation.

-   But within neuropsychology, where does the real leading innovation happen.

    -   Where is the home of neuropsychology innovation currently?

    -   It certainly isn't the Oliver Zangwill centre.

    -   You might say a University? Sure, but often the neuropsycchology models that come out of Universities are based on cases that appear in routine practice.

-   I am going to make a case for SRFT.

    -   For years I worked as an AP in and around Manchester - it was always Salford.

        -   The leading clinicians.

        -   The innovative services.

        -   A heavy volume of peer reviewed research.

    -   Always trainees wanting to be on placement here. It's certainly why I requested to come on placement here.

    -   The surgical pathways, the NEAD service....
:::

## Feedback

What came to everyone's minds?

1.  Are we **`Consumers`** or **`Producers`** of technology?

2.  What innovations have **`You`** been involved with?

3.  Which **`Colleagues`** do you look towards?

::: notes
-   So with that. Hopefully now is a nice point to step backwards and look to these questions that I previously put.

-   Can be challenging to toot our own trumpet - but it's important that we are able to communicate this part of what we do.

::: notes
-   Spent the first part of the presentation trying to fire us up.

-   But there is also a need to acknowledge that

    -   Although there are truly inspirational developments happening in neuropsychology.

    -   There are also a lot of areas, where things have become awfully stale.

-   Qinteractive - Is this really the best that we can do in terms of an electronic assessment platform.

-   Old fashioned resources - Handouts cheaply formatted that look like they have been produced on Microsoft 95 and printed to the cheapest possible paper.

-   Outdated assessments - Often joke in the office about the majority of assessments used in in clinical practice being older than I am.

    -   WAIS is the best part of 20 years old.

    -   DKEFS = 2001.

-   Irrelevant norms

-   Manual scoring

-   VR, NLP and precision medicine

-   Automated Reports

-   Gap between a new innovation (research) and implementing it into healthcare, but also some of these problems aren't technological - some of them are more about implementation and access. I would certainly say that a lot of these are solvable problems.

-   A lot to be proud of in neuropsychology, however we probably are a critical point where we need to kick on with the field, in a similar way that other fields have been.

-   These shouldn't feel like a far reach, or something closer to science fiction than clinical practice.

-   In a world where ChatGPT can write presentation for me, surgical procedures can be conducted remotely, chat bots are delivering psychotherapy, almost any electronic device in your home can now be controlled from your phone WHY is it that I am still spending hours of time on quite simple administrative processes, why can it still take many hours to test a patient, and why does it take months to get the results back to someone.

::: notes
-   Recently learnt about disruptive tech.

    -   New term for me!

-   I am not sure that neuropsychology have had a truly disruptive innovation yet. But I really hope it's coming!

-   Disruptive innovations = Innovations that make expensive or sophisticated products and services accessible and more affordable to a broader market.

-   **Disruptive innovation** refers to the use of technology that upsets a structure, as opposed to **"disruptive technology"**, which refers to the technology itself.

-   Disruptive Technology refers to changes and innovations in a sector that are so profound they alter the way service is rendered or performed--*disrupting* the old market, and creating an entirely new market, with significant societal impact. Some examples of disruptive technology are the smartphone, digital photography, and companies such as Amazon, Tesla, Uber, and AirBnB.

## Conversions {auto-animate="true" auto-animate-duration="1.3"}

-   `Look-Up Tables`

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Decimal places and rounding can influence precision.
-   Increment length can influence precision.
-   The best metric to use is likely to vary based on the purpose for use.

## Conversions {auto-animate="true" auto-animate-duration="1.3"}

. . .

An alternative approach is to use a `Formula`.

$$
X_{new} =
\frac{s_{new}}{s_{old}}
(X_{old} - \bar{X}_{old})
+ \bar{X}_{new}
$$

. . .

**However** this can be

**Problems with Look-Up Tables**

For a full version of a traditional look-up table click [here](https://guardianadlitem.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Psychometric-Conversion-Table.pdf).

-   $Z$ score of 1.7 to a standard score.
-   Standard scores 126, and 127, to $T$ scores.
-   Percentile rank of 87 to a scaled score.

Looks ups become constrained - they often aren't granular enough to be able to ensure exact matches. And if they did then the table would be really long.
:::

## **Considerations** {visibility="hidden"}

-   Decimal places and rounding can influence precision.
-   Increment length can influence precision.
-   The best metric to use is likely to vary based on the purpose for use.

**Summary:** `Look-Up` tables can be problematic.

An alternative approach is to use a `Formula`.

::: notes
-   Tables need to be really clear.

-   But getting them to look really good is quite tricky (particularly using MS Word).

-   Particularly if there is a perception that it is unlikely to be used again / by someone else.

-   Important that all the important information is there - particularly is someone comes back to repeat the assessment in the future.

::: notes
Finally - problem 3.

-   useful when working with data. We work with a lot of data.

-   Once you have converted all your scores to a single metric.

-   And you have gone to the effort to put the data into a table and attached it to the EPR, the last thing we want to do is spend more time on admin / processing the data.

-   And partly because of that, and also because it is just challenging to do, lots of people skip this part out.

-   I think we are really missing a trick here because graphs are really powerful - for interpretation and also communication.

> `Score Connveter` <br>A web app for converting, tabulating, and visualising neuropsychological test results.

`Conversions`

-   Formula based
-   Flexibly change

`Tabulation`

-   Consistent principles
-   Conditional formatting and row ordering

`Visualisation`

-   A range of plots (bar, forest radar, bell curves)

::: notes
-   Score converter is an attempt to bring some of these ideas together.

-   Converts scores but allows you to alter which your preferred score is.

-   It produces tables that are reactive (alter how rows are arranged, for example grouping together tests on certain domains).

-   Highlight all test scores that meet a certain criteria (e.g., show in bright red all scores that are 1 SD below the mean).

-   A range of plots you can produce - as explained they are variations on a theme. One axis has the test and the other axis has the score.

Demonstration

-   The app walks your through how to upload an excel sheet of test scores (e.g., for a battery of scores) so that you can convert, tabulate, and visualise large amounts of test scores at once.

-   There are example datasets that people can easily select. This allows people to get a feel for what it produces, before having to commit to inputting scores into the spreadsheet.

-   In terms of input it just required you to enter a single standardised score of any type. Unfortunately the app doesn't convert from raw score score.

-   Print to pdf allows for a simple pdf that you can upload to the EPR.

Forest plot

-   Rapidly get a sense of the distribution of test scores.

Radar plot

-   Look quite nice - although in my opinion they are quite hard to interpret.

-   Perhaps good for communication information to patients

Bell curve

-   Kind of useful - perhaps less so for patients because need to understand Z scores.

Bar plot

-   Based on Z scores.

-   Reactive.

## Limitations & Next Steps

-   Likely to have bugs / problems unyet identified

-   Data Input (Excel) is clunky.

-   Not yet able to express confidence intervals.

-   Has not been subjected to extensive user testing.

::: notes
Next steps

-   Write up / disseminate.

-   Develop the app to address some of these limitations.

-   Continue working on some of the other apps that I also rarely get time to develop.

-   AACN DTI Slide show

    -   We are the original tech innovators.

    -   not just about efficiency, its about changing the industry.

    -   AACN video is https://theaacn.org/disruptive-technology-initiative/introduction-karen-postal/

-   We believe education should break free from traditional silos and embrace coding, biotechnology, and engineering, among other fields. We believe there is opportunity for radical innovation in the measurement of brain function, cognition and behavior, and reimagining of how these data are analyzed, interpreted, and applied.

-   As neuropsychologists we are perfectly positioned to leverage strong scientific knowledge and research skills to produce market-disrupting technology and services. We understand the importance of economic value balanced with the clinical utility of our services and are devoted to the concepts of individual differences and diversity. Neuropsychologists developed ground-breaking tools to measure cognition and have used them to inform advances in medical and mental health diagnosis and care. We have clinics, research infrastructure andbusiness relationships that help position us for rapid technological innovation.
